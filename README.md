# Othello Game

**COEN 244 Class Project**  
**Date:** 11/10/2023

This repository contains an enhanced implementation of the classic Othello (Reversi) game.

## Project Overview

This project was developed for the **COEN 244** class. 

*   **Language Switch**: The game logic was originally designed in **C++**, but has been ported to **Python** for greater convenience and portability.
*   **UI Upgrade**: The user interface has been completely overhauled. It now features a fully graphical interface (GUI) built with Python's Turtle library, replacing the standard console output with an interactive window.

## Features

*   **Interactive Menu System**: A retro-style main menu with options to Play, view Settings, or Quit.
*   **Multiple Game Modes**:
    *   **Vs Computer**: Challenge the AI. You can choose your color (Black goes first, White goes second).
    *   **Vs Player**: A local 2-player mode to play against a friend on the same machine.
*   **Visual Enhancements**:
    *   **Move Highlighting**: Possible legal moves are highlighted with blue dots to assist decision-making.
    *   **Live Status**: Real-time display of the current turn and score (piece count).
    *   **Themed Design**: Classic Othello board colors (Forest Green background with Black/White tiles).

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Run the game using:

```bash
python game.py
```

## Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Python 3
*   **Graphics**: Turtle Graphics Module (Standard Python Library)
